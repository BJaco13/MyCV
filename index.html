        <h2>Jaco Beukes</h2>

        <p class = "aboutp" >I am an aspiring software developer, passionate about learning and growing in the industry. My
            first experience with coding was probably in grade 10 when I started learning with the program
            Scratch. Since then I've worked on to improving my skills, I love to take on a challenge, especially
            when others can't find a solution. I enjoy creating new things and improving processes with out-of-the-box 
            thinking.<br><br>
            I worked at a coffee shop as a barista, and eventually the junior manager for about three years. I
            learned as much as I could about coffee, but found myself in charge of the point of sale systems,
            managing the database and the website. It was here that I realized I wanted to make a career in
            software development and decided to study software development through Hyperion Dev.<br><br>
            I believe that I'm a great team player no matter the role, and this has been proven in my previous
            roles at the coffee shop. I love supporting a lead but would also not shy away from taking the lead.
            I hold honesty, trust, respect, and transparency in high regard not only in my personal life but also
            in the workplace. I believe that when these values are upheld, a team can truly come together and
            get the task done to the best of their ability.<br><br>
            I believe that the skills and attributes I have will be
            a valuable contribution to any company or team in which I find myself.</p>
